<h2>WEB</h2>
<P>The World Wide Web (WWW, W3) is a worldwide information space where people can share information through computers connected to the Internet . Often referred to simply as the Web . The term is often used synonymously with the Internet, but strictly speaking they are different concepts. The Web is just one service that runs on the Internet, like e-mail . However, since 1993, the Web has occupied an absolute place in the structure of the Internet.

    It also refers to a transmission method that exchanges pictures and characters using the HTTP protocol , hypertext , HTML format, etc. on the Internet .</p>
