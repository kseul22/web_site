<h2>CSS</h2>
<P>A Cascading Style Sheet ( English : Cascading Style Sheet ) is a style language ( English : Style sheet language [ * ] ) that describes how the markup language is actually displayed [1] . It is mainly used for XHTML , but can also be used for XML . It is a W3C standard, and it has a high degree of freedom when defining layout and style .

    The default file name [2] is style.css.
    
    If a markup language (ex: HTML ) is in charge of the body of a website, CSS can be said to be in charge of decorating it like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can decorate it like a completely different website by leaving the HTML structure as it is and changing only the CSS file .
    
    In the case of CSS3 currently under development, functions that can replace images created with graphic editing programs such as shadow effect, gradation , and transformation have been added. In addition, various animation functions have been added, replacing Adobe Flash to some extent.
